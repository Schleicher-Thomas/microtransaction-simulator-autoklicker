# microtransaction-simulator-autoklicker

this project is not finished yet, but the script works fine when running the game on a 108ÃŸ primary monitor
development might be as slow as a snail climbing mount everest

## Description

Are you tired of clicking and clicking? Have you already developed carpal tunnel syndrome from opening cards for 4 hours?

This simple script buys new cards and opens them for you.

## Visuals

## Installation
you need to install python and pynput on your computer to run this script

## Usage
to run the file you have type "autoklicker.py" into your Windows terminal and then press 'w'

## Support
the button coordinates are coded for your primary monitor to have 1080p
you can adjust the button coordinates yourself if you have a different screen resolution
to find your own button coordinates you can just make a screenshot of the game and open it in paint
the current mouse coordinates are displayed in the bottom left corner

If you have any questions, hit me up

## Roadmap
not yet planned, maybe I'll fix typos in this readme, but tbh this is just a quick little project for personal usage, and nothing to showcase

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
idc, just do whatever you want

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
